# TextFieldEffects

I fell in love with the text inputs effects in [this article](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/01/08/inspiration-text-input-effects/). As an exercise I decided to recreate as many of them as I can using Swift *(some of them have a personal touch)*.

Currently it features the following effects from the article:

- [x] Kaede
- [x] Hoshi
- [x] Jiro
- [x] Isao
- [x] Minoru
- [x] Yoko
- [x] Madoka

## Installation

### Manual

The easiest way to install this framework is to drag and drop the `TextFieldEffects/TextFieldEffects` folder into your project. This also prevents the `frameworks` problem in iOS where the IBInspectable and IBDesignable are stripped out.

### Carthage

Add the following to your Cartfile:

``` ruby
github "raulriera/TextFieldEffects"
```


## How to use them

Check out the demo project to see the configuration options for each effect.
